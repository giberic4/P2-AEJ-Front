Project 2 - Artur, Eric, John R.

## Project Overview
Animal crossing is a game about cute animated animals living together in a cozy town or island. It is known for housing customization. Unlocking furniture, crafting furniture, and showing off your creativity. With hundreds of items and many variations of those items available in game, it gives us a basis for our own e-commerce oasis. Each user will be able to create their own account, search through the animal crossing item library, and trade those items. When a user creates their account, they will be given a starting balance that they can spend on an item from the marksetplace or a random item from a grab bag. We are treating the platform as an open market where sellers and buyers control the price of an item. We hope to include some mini-games that reflect aspects of Animal Crossing.

### Git Practice/Process (merge/code review practice/branch protection)  
- we will make branches for feature/some-feature-name
- have a dev branch where we push changes to when a feature is complete
- dev branch is audited when a feature is pushed by another member during a meeting time
- feature needs 60 percent unit test code coverage
- main is pushed to when we finish

### Coding Convention/Practice :
